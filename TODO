NOW
[ ] rename the shit function to something recognizable
[ ] migrate from http.createClient to http.request
[ ] split up OAuth handling from http request like GFTwitterManager
[ ] add proper request/access examples with Flatiron
[ ] add google example
[ ] expose oauthParams var to override oauth_signature_method and more

LATER
[ ] rework Mouth object to hold instance state, consumer key/secret and oauth token/secret where appropriate?
[ ] combine postParams and postBuffer vars and add var to control if included in the base for signing?
[ ] add multipart contentType and buffer example, twitter update_with_media.json?
[ ] consider simple wrapper on OAuth 2 now that facebook, google and github are over there?
